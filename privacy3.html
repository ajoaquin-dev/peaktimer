    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: Jan 22, 2026</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to TalkToYou - Journal ("App"), developed by Joaquin Arino
            ("we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent
            about how and why data is collected and used.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>User Interaction Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            We collect limited analytics data to understand how users interact with the app and to
            improve functionality and user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            This data is collected using PostHog and includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>App interactions (such as feature usage, screen views, and button taps)</li>
            <li>Basic device and app information (e.g. app version, OS version)</li>
            <li>A pseudonymous unique identifier (UUID) assigned to each user</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The UUID allows us to analyze usage patterns over time and is considered
            <strong>linked to the user’s identity</strong> under applicable privacy definitions.
            We do not use this identifier to directly identify you by name, email address, or real-world identity.
        </p>

        <h3>Subscription Information</h3>
        <p>
            For premium features, we use RevenueCat as our payment processor. RevenueCat collects:

            <li>Transaction information (such as transaction ID and subscription status)</li>
            <li>Basic device information required for subscription management</li>
        </ul>
